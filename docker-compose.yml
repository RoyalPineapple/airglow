# Airglow - AirPlay ➜ LedFX Stack
#
# This stack provides AirPlay 2 audio streaming to LedFX for real-time LED visualization.
# Audio flows: AirPlay Device → Shairport-Sync → PulseAudio → LedFX → LED Devices
#
# Network Architecture:
# - airglow-web: Bridge networking (port 8080 exposed)
# - ledfx: Bridge networking (ports 8888, 5568, 6454, 21324, 4048, 8889, 4002, 4003 exposed)
#   Note: Philips Hue uses outbound HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) - no ports exposed
# - shairport-sync: Host networking (required for mDNS/Bonjour AirPlay discovery)
#
# Note: shairport-sync uses host networking for mDNS/Bonjour AirPlay discovery.
# ledfx uses bridge networking with port mappings for LED device communication.

    ports:
      - "8888:8888"      # Web UI and API (HTTP)

      - "6454:6454/udp"  # ArtNet protocol (DMX over Ethernet)
      - "21324:21324/udp" # WLED UDP protocol (unicast)
      - "4048:4048/udp"  # DDP protocol (unicast)
      - "8889:8889/udp"  # WLED device discovery (optional but recommended)
      - "4002:4002/udp"  # Govee device responses (receive port)
      - "4003:4003/udp"  # Govee device control (send commands to device)
      # Note: Philips Hue uses outbound HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443) to Hue Bridge
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX makes outbound connections to the bridge
      # Note: LIFX uses outbound UDP (port 56700) for device communication
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends commands and receives responses automatically
      # Note: Nanoleaf uses outbound HTTP (port 16021) and UDP (port 60222/60221) for device communication
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX makes outbound connections to the device
      # Note: OpenPixelControl uses outbound UDP (port 7890) for device communication
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends pixel data to OPC devices
      # Note: OpenRGB uses outbound TCP (port 6742 default) to OpenRGB SDK server
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX connects to OpenRGB server on host/network
      # Note: OSC (Open Sound Control) uses outbound UDP (port 9000 default, configurable)
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends OSC messages to OSC servers
      # Note: Novation Launchpad uses USB MIDI (via rtmidi library)
      # No network ports needed - requires USB device passthrough if used
      # Note: RPi WS281X uses Raspberry Pi GPIO pins (local hardware interface)
      # No network ports needed - requires GPIO access and /dev/mem if used in Docker
      # Note: Twinkly Squares uses outbound HTTP/HTTPS and UDP (port 7777) for real-time frames
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX connects to Twinkly devices
      # Note: Zengge/MagicHome/FluxLED uses outbound UDP (port 5577) for device control
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends commands to FluxLED devices
      # Note: UDP Realtime Device uses configurable UDP ports (default 21324, same as WLED UDP)
      # No additional ports needed - uses same ports as WLED UDP protocol
